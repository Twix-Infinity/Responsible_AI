What’s happening:
    A system flags students as "cheating" based on eye movement — but it often flags neurodivergent students.

What’s problematic:
    Neurodivergent students are at a disadvantage/ face discrimination because the AI often flags neurodivergent students compared to normal students.
    The parents of these children will not be happy that their children are being flagged out just because they are different.
    This isn't a good image for the school.

One improvement idea:
    The names of all the neurodivergent students should be noted down and the AI should evaluate them more liniently.
