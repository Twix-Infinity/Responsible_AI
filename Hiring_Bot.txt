What’s happening:
    A company uses an AI to screen job applicants.
    It tends to reject more female applicants with career gaps

What’s problematic:
    This bot is gender biased which means female aplicants are disadvantaged/ facing discrimination.
    This isn't a good image for the company.
    The company will be male dominated.

One improvement idea:
    Prompt the AI of the Hiring bot to accept an equal ratio of men to women.
