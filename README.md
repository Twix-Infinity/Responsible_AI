🧠 Assignment: “AI in the Real World — Judge the Bot"

Description

✅ Assignment Brief (student-facing)

You’re now a Responsible AI Inspector 🕵️‍♂️. Your job is to investigate how AI is used in a scenario, spot anything suspicious (bias? lack of transparency?), and help fix it. You'll be given 2 short cases.

Your mission:
1. Describe what the AI is doing.

2. Spot what could go wrong (hint: check fairness, privacy, accountability...)

3. Suggest 1 way to improve it responsibly.

🎨 Bonus points if you write your answer like a short blog post explaining the issue in a fun and clear way.

Think of it as being a detective — but make it vibe.
